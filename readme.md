# Quantum test tasks on intern Datascientist vaccancy 
### Structure 
- [task1_bert_alternative_implementation](https://github.com/Ak1yamaKiyoshi/quantummobile-tasks/tree/main/task1_bert_alternative_implementation)
First implementation of first task using pytorch and Hugging face transformers pre-trained BERT model.

- [task1_nlp_ner](https://github.com/Ak1yamaKiyoshi/quantummobile-tasks/tree/main/task1_nlp_ner)
Main, right one implementation of first task. Used SpaCy and some other utilites.
Compared to the first attempt, the dataset, how it is generated and used,
has changed significantly. The model and the way it is trained have also changed.
The training time has improved. The number of parameters is much smaller compared to BERT.
- [task2_sift_feature_registration](https://github.com/Ak1yamaKiyoshi/quantummobile-tasks/tree/main/task2_sift_feature_registration)
Second task implementation using cv2 library for feature recognizing.
